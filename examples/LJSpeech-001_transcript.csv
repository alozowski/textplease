00:00:00	00:00:07	Printing, in the only sense with which we are at present concerned, differs from most, if not from all the arts
00:00:07	00:00:11	and crafts represented in the exhibition in being comparatively modern.
00:00:12	00:00:20	For although the Chinese took impressions from wood blocks engraved in relief for centuries before the woodcutters of the Netherlands, by
00:00:20	00:00:28	a similar process, produced the block books which were the immediate predecessors of the true printed book, the invention of movable
00:00:28	00:00:35	metal letters in the middle of the fifteenth century may justly be considered as the invention of the art of printing.
00:00:35	00:00:44	And it is worth mention in passing that as an example of fine typography, the earliest book printed with movable types,
00:00:44	00:00:51	the Guttenberg, or 42 line Bible, of about 1455, has never been surpassed.
00:00:52	00:00:59	Printing, then, for our purpose, may be considered as the art of making books by means of movable types.
00:01:00	00:01:09	Now, as all books not primarily intended as picture books, consist principally of types composed to form letter press, it is
00:01:09	00:01:16	of the first importance that the letter used should be fine in form, especially as no more time is occupied or
00:01:16	00:01:24	cost incurred in casting, setting, or printing beautiful letters than in the same operations with ugly ones.
00:01:24	00:01:31	And it was a matter of course that in the Middle Ages, when the craftsmen took care that beautiful forms should
00:01:31	00:01:37	always be a part of their productions, whatever they were, the forms of printed letters should be beautiful, and that their
00:01:37	00:01:43	arrangement on the page should be reasonable and a help to the shapeliness of the letters themselves.
