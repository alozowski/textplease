00:00:00	00:07:07	Printing, in the only sense with which we are at present concerned, differs from most, if not from all the arts
00:07:07	00:11:11	and crafts represented in the exhibition in being comparatively modern.
00:12:12	00:20:20	For although the Chinese took impressions from wood blocks engraved in relief for centuries before the woodcutters of the Netherlands, by
00:20:20	00:28:28	a similar process, produced the block books which were the immediate predecessors of the true printed book, the invention of movable
00:28:28	00:35:35	metal letters in the middle of the fifteenth century may justly be considered as the invention of the art of printing.
00:35:35	00:44:44	And it is worth mention in passing that as an example of fine typography, the earliest book printed with movable types,
00:44:44	00:51:51	the Guttenberg, or 42 line Bible, of about 1455, has never been surpassed.
00:52:52	00:09:09	Printing, then, for our purpose, may be considered as the art of making books by means of movable types. Now, as all books not primarily intended as picture books, consist principally of types composed to form letter press, it is
00:09:09	00:16:16	of the first importance that the letter used should be fine in form, especially as no more time is occupied or
00:16:16	00:24:24	cost incurred in casting, setting, or printing beautiful letters than in the same operations with ugly ones.
00:24:24	00:31:31	And it was a matter of course that in the Middle Ages, when the craftsmen took care that beautiful forms should
00:31:31	00:37:37	always be a part of their productions, whatever they were, the forms of printed letters should be beautiful, and that their
00:37:37	00:43:43	arrangement on the page should be reasonable and a help to the shapeliness of the letters themselves.
