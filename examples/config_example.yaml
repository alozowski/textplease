# ASR Model Settings
model_name: "nvidia/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2" # or "openai/whisper-large-v3" (unstable)
device: "cpu"  # "cpu" as a default; "cuda", or "mps" for Apple (may be unstable)

# Memory and Processing
chunk_duration_minutes: 1  # Break long audio into chunks (minutes); lower if facing memory issues
max_batch_size: 1          # Affects memory usage and speed

# Segmentation Parameters
similarity_threshold: 0.45            # [0.0â€“1.0] Lower = more segments merge; higher = stricter segmentation
pause_threshold: 3                    # Max allowed pause (seconds) between words to merge segments
max_segment_words: 15                 # Max number of words in a segment before forcing a split
min_segment_words: 3                  # Minimum words required for a standalone segment
min_segment_chars: 20                 # Minimum characters required for a standalone segment
embedding_model: "all-mpnet-base-v2"  # Model used to compute semantic similarity for merging

# Logging and Output
